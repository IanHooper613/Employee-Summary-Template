# Employee-Summary-Template
This Employee Summary Template is a Node CLI that takes information about employees, and generates 
an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.  
A manager may want to generate a webpage that displays a team's basic info, so that they can have
quick access to e-mails and GitHub profiles.
